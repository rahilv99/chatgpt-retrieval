       In his book Zero to One, Peter Thiel states, �The most valuable businesses will be built by entrepreneurs who seek to 
       empower people rather than try to make them obsolete.� This embodies my philosophy in engineering and is a core value 
       of mine.  
       
       In addition to my commitment to empowering others, I am well-qualified for this position. In my freshman year, I 
       created Link, a location-based interactive platform, to make meeting up with friends amidst the hustle of college 
       life easier. Rather than navigating conflicting schedules to coordinate lunch plans, one can select a location,
        like the dining hall, and mark an intended visit while others in the group can view and join the event. Live 
        location enables individuals heading in the same direction or with overlapping breaks to plan activities effortlessly.
         I developed Link alongside two other developers utilizing Xcode and Firebase. In November of 2023, I began 
         consulting through the Duke Consulting Club for Glow, a startup with a similar event-planning idea. Through
          conversations with the owner of Glow and my team, we decided it would be best for us to sell Link to Glow 
          to integrate our technologies and create a better user experience. 

	In addition to my individual initiatives, I have technical expertise that would prove useful in an innovative 
       company. As a teaching assistant for CS201 (Data Structures and Algorithms), I have had the opportunity to lead
        a weekly discussion section and office hours covering the fundamentals of coding in Java. Outside of the classroom, 
        I worked at the Center for Global Women�s Health Technologies writing Python and MATLAB code to process images 
        of breast cancer tumors. My programs significantly increased efficiency, demonstrating my capacity to improve 
        operations by making data-driven decisions. I also have proficiency in CAD using Fusion360 and SolidWorks from 
        my time spent in Duke Enable. I model and construct prosthetics using 3D scans that help our clients break through 
        the limits of their physical disabilities. You can check out more about my personal projects and technical 
        skills at my website rahilverma.com.

	My proficiency in technical skills, interpersonal skills, and dedication to problem-solving make me a valuable 
       asset. Thank you for considering my application.
